## üöÄ Project Overview

**Axion** is an innovative, web-based SaaS platform designed to transform the way full-stack applications are built. Imagine having an intelligent co-pilot that generates code and provides an interactive development environment ‚Äì that's Axion. We're on a mission to dramatically streamline the development workflow, enabling faster prototyping and the rapid creation of robust applications with the power of artificial intelligence.

**What problem does Axion solve?** Traditional full-stack development can be time-consuming and complex. Axion addresses this by automating repetitive coding tasks, providing instant feedback, and integrating essential services, allowing developers to focus on core logic and innovation.

## ‚ö° Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run Axion locally for development or testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS version recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/adityapawar327/Axion.git](https://github.com/adityapawar327/Axion.git)
    cd Axion
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install  # Or: yarn install
    ```
3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a file named `.env.local` in the root directory of the project. Populate it with your API keys and configuration settings for Google Generative AI, Google OAuth, Convex, and PayPal.

    ```
    # Example .env.local
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth_client_id_here
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_oauth_client_secret_here
    CONVEX_DEPLOY_URL=your_convex_deployment_url_here
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=your_convex_deployment_url_here # Often same as CONVEX_DEPLOY_URL for client-side
    PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_paypal_client_id_here
    PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_paypal_client_secret_here
    # Add any other environment variables as required by your project
    ```
    * **Important**: Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control.

4.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev # Or: yarn dev
    ```
    Axion should now be running locally! Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the application.
